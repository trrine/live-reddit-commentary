# Live Reddit Commentary (in progress)
 Chrome extension for displaying live Reddit comments while streaming TV shows.

### TO DO:
- Make comment section moveable
- Handle replies

### Limitations
The Reddit API only allows fetching the 1000 most recent comments on a post. For this reason, this extension is best suited for watching live-streamed rather than recorded TV - even with the lag option.
