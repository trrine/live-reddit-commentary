## Description
The Live Reddit Commentary Chrome extension allows you to effortlessly view real-time comments from Reddit discussions directly within your browser. Designed for live TV show streams and episode discussions, this extension keeps you connected with the conversation without the need to constantly keep checking Reddit and refreshing the page. Simply enter the URL of a live discussion post on Reddit, set the display delay and lag time, and start receiving live commentary as it happens.

### Features:
- View real-time comments from Reddit discussions during live TV show streams
- Customise display delay and lag time for a personalised experience
- Resizable and draggable comment section with integrated dark mode toggle

### Limitations
The Reddit API only allows fetching the 1000 most recent comments on a post. For this reason, this extension is best suited for watching live-streamed rather than recorded TV content - even with the lag option.

## Acknowledgements
- Code for making comment section draggable adapted from [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_draggable.asp).

### TO DO:
- Handle replies
- Isolate to single tab
