- Make comment section moveable
- Handle replies

## How to Use

### Limitations
The Reddit API only allows fetching the 1000 most recent comments on a post. For this reason, this extension is best suited for watching live-streamed rather than recorded TV content - even with the lag option.

## Acknowledgements
- Code for making comment section draggable adapted from [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_draggable.asp).
